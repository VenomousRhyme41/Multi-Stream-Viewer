## What You Can Do

**Watch Multiple Streams**
Keep up with all your favorite streamers at the same time. No more switching between tabs.

**Supports All Major Platforms**
YouTube, Twitch, Kick, and most embed links work right out of the box.

**Theater Mode**
Hide everything except the streams for a distraction-free experience.

---

## Quick Start

1. Go to the [live site](https://venomousrhyme41.github.io/Multi-Stream-Viewer/)
2. Paste stream URLs into the input boxes
3. Click "Load Stream" for each one
4. Hit theater mode if you want a cleaner view

That's it. No setup, no downloads, no accounts needed.

---

## Coming Soon

- Removing the blank spaces between streams in 4-stream mode
- A clean twitch dropdown that shows the top 5 stream with the most view counts

*These updates might happen eventually, no promises though*
